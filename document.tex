\subsection{Area of a Triangle}
\begin{align*}
A 	&= \frac{bh}{2} \\
	&= rs \\
	&= \frac{1}{2}ab\sin\theta \\
	&= \frac{abc}{4R}
\end{align*}
Where $ A $ is the area,
$ b $ is the base,
and $ h $ is the height.
In the second equation,
$ r $ is the inradius 
and $ s $ is the semiperimeter (which is half the perimeter).
In the third equation, 
$ \theta $ is the angle between two sides $ a $, $ b $ of the triangle.
In the final equation,
$ a $, $ b $, $ c $ are the sides of the triangle with circumradius $ R $.


\subsection{Area of a Square (and kite/rhombus)*}
\begin{align*}
A	&= bh \\
	&= s^2 \\
	&= \frac{d_1 \dot d_2}{2}
\end{align*}
Where $ A $ is the area,
$ b $ is the base,
$ h $ is the height,
$ s $ is the side length,
and $ d_{1,2} $ are the lengths of the diagonals.
The prior equation only applies to squares.
The latter formula applies to any quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals (such as kites and rhombi).
